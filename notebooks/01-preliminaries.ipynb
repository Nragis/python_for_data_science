    "## 1.2 Why Python for Data Analysis?\n",
    "- Python has a large and active scientific computing and data analysis community\n",
    "- Compared to R, MATLAB, SAS, Stata, etc, Python has far greater usability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python as Glue\n",
    "- Python can easily utilize C, C++, and FORTRAN code, allowing the user the ease\n",
    "    of use of Python while getting the efficiency and power of those languages.\n",
    "- Python is used as the \"Glue Code\" tying together computations and libraries.\n",
    "    The runtime of this glue code is nearly insignificant, and the improvement\n",
    "    in development speed can far outweigh the cost in computation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the \"Two-Language\" Problem\n",
    "- In most applications, it's common to have a research / prototyping language \n",
    "    and a production language\n",
    "    - Research languages tend to be SAS or R\n",
    "    - Production languages tend to be C, C++, C#, FORTRAN, Java, etc\n",
    "- Python acomplishes the task of both of these categories due to the heavy \n",
    "    lifting being done by C/C++ code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Not Python?\n",
    "- Applications that need very low latency (high freq trading), the time lost\n",
    "    in programming directly in C/C++ to acheive maximum performance might be \n",
    "    worthwhile\n",
    "- Python struggles in many parallel computing problems like multithreading due\n",
    "    to the restriction that Python's interpreter can only execute one \n",
    "    instruction at a time\n",
    "    - Python C  libraries can execute truly parallel code, but they cannot \n",
    "        communicate with Python objects simultaneously."
